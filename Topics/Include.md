# Includes

ePublisher Markdown++ gives the author the ability to create include statements. Includes statements are a smart way to make larger document set more managable. For example, you could have one topics Markdown file which would contain titles and include statements. This would allow a topic base workflow where topics can be updated or added with relative ease. In the source documents supplied with the **ePublisher Express Trial** the file named `"Exploring ePublisher_Topics_Page.md"` is an example of this type of workflow. 

## How to Write an Include Statement

Include statements are done via comments in the Markdown document. Here is an example of the syntax used: 
`<!--include: (<Insert file name/path Here>)-->`

In the `"Exploring ePublisher_Topics_Page.md"` screen shot below you can see where general Titles were listed with comments to add keywords and anchors. Then include statements were used to list the topics under the Title.
