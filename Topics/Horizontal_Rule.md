# Horizontal Rule 

Markdown syntax also provides for horizontal rule tag `<hr />` to be placed in the document by placing three or more symbols on a line by themselves. A horizontal rule is used to show a separation between content. We use page breaks to separate main topics in this guide. If you were to have a single scrolling page for your HTML output, horizontal rules would be a good feature to show separation between topics. The symbols can be hyphens, asterisks, or underscores. Each of the below examples would produce a horizontal rule. 

**Syntax Example**
```
* * *

***

****

- - -

___

```

This is what a horizontal rule looks like in the generated output.

**ePublisher** default settings style the horizontal rule as a boarder width 1px, color default and style is inset. This can be changed in **ePublisher** **Designer** and your customizations saved to a stationery. 

<!--style:mdnote-->
Note - When using a style like Inset, Outset, Grooved, or Ridged keep the color set at default so all the details of the style can be seen.

<!--style:mdnote-->
Note - Best practices for a horizontal rule is to leave a blank line before and after the line that contains the symbols
