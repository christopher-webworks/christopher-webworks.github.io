This next section is so we can show an example of the Relevance Ranking search feature in Reverb 2.0. The
**ePublisher Express Trial** guild talks about this feature and others. We walk you through all the features in the
Search Showcase section of the guide. So, you can ignore the next couple of sections and move on down to Creating
Your Own Content and Using Media Assets.

## This doesn't have brown in it a lot, so why is it on top?

Video provides a powerful way to help you deliver a message or show the steps in a procedure. When you click Online
Video, you can paste the embed code for the video you want to add. You can also type a keyword to search online for
the video that best fits your document. To make your document look professionally produced, Word provides header,
footer, cover page, and text box designs that complement each other. For example, you can add a matching cover page,
header, and sidebar. Click Insert and then choose the elements you want from the different galleries. Themes and
styles also help keep your document coordinated.

When you click Design and choose a new Theme, the pictures, charts, and SmartArt graphics change to match your new
theme. When you apply styles, your headings change to match the new theme. Save time in Word with new buttons that
show up where you need them. To change the way a picture fits in your document, click it and a button for layout
options appears next to it. When you work on a table, click where you want to add a row or a column, and then click
the plus sign. Reading is easier, too, in the new Reading view. You can collapse parts of the document and focus
on the text you want.

# Creating Your Own Content and Using Media Assets 

The previous sections showed you just a sample of the power of **ePublisher**. We wanted to give you an area where
you could use your content and possibly some of your media assets. This area is in the document located in the
"My Edits" section of the Document Manager window in **ePublisher Express**. If you have enjoyed your experience
with **ePublisher** and would like to learn more, check out the "Next Steps" section located in your
**ePublisher Express Trial**. 

You can also contact us at **877-6-WEBWORKS** or **(877) 693-2967**. Our sales department can answer any questions
