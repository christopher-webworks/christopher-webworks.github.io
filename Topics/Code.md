# Code and Code Fence

Code blocks are part of the Markdown standard syntax. **ePublisher** allows for Inline-style code and code fences. For the syntax only the back quote key is used. Alternatively known as acute, backtick, left quote, or an open quote, the back quote is a punctuation mark located on the same key as the tilde symbol (left side if the keyboard above the tab key). To create an inline code or a code fence, you will just change the number of entries for the back quote key. 

The back quote key will surround the area of code you would like to pass through to the HTML output. **ePublisher** will present the code area in the HTML output exactly as it appears in the source documents. The back quote will not be seen in the output, and **ePublisher** will highlight the code with a standard gray background. 

Here are the examples for Code syntax. 

**Inline-style code** 
`\`<Code Type Content Here>\``
 
This is an example of an inline-style `<Code Type Content Here>`. The area of code has a single back quote preceding it and a single back quote at the end of the code. 

**Code Fence** 
`\`\`\`` 
`<Multi-line Code Fence Content Here>` 
`\`\`\``

```
This is an example of a code fence.
You can enter as much content as you would like. 
All that is required is to precede the code fence with three back quotes and end it with three back quotes. 
```
