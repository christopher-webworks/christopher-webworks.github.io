# HTML in Markdown 

By default, we convert HTML tags in to divs in the output. For example a `<h1></h1>` in HTML will appear as `<div class=Heading_1>`
Markdown also allows for raw HTML. There is no need to put any syntax around the code, but it needs to stand alone in the source document by leaving a blank line directly above and directly below.  A good example of using raw HTML in a Markdown document is when embedding a Youtube video. In the "My Edits" file there is a section of raw HTML code. **ePublisher** allows for HTML in Markdown and already has some predefined HTML code. This section will cover using raw HTML to imbed video and blockquotes.

This code was generated by the Youtube embed option under share videos. Taking that code straight from Youtube, it appears in the output like this:

Note- Any HTML5 code is able to pass through to the generated output.
